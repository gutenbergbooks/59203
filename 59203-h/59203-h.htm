<h2><a name="A_FOREWORD" id="A_FOREWORD"></a>A FOREWORD</h2>

<p>It is hard for me to realize that this is a first volume of verse. Most
of the initial ventures that have passed under my jaundiced eye have
been precisely what such early collections are expected to be. They
were, as Wilde expressed it somewhere, “promissory notes&mdash;that are never
met.”... But though it is hard for me to believe that this is a first
book, it is still harder for me to believe that this is Maxwell
Bodenheim’s first book. In these days of the much advertised “poetic
renaissance,” when the <i>Dial</i> out-radicals the <i>Little Review</i>, and even
the New York <i>Tribune</i> prints <i>vers-libre</i> on its editorial page, I
expected to see nothing less than Bodenheim’s Collected works.... This
pleasure will evidently have to be deferred.... Meanwhile, here is an
indication, and no slight one, of how distinguished and decorative that
collection will be. Without Kreymborg’s caustic and acerb irony, or
Johns’ fluent lyricism, Bodenheim has something that neither they nor,
for that matter, any of his colleagues in “<i>Others</i>” possess. I refer to
his extreme sensitivity to words. Words, under his hands, have
unexpected growths; placid nouns and sober adjectives bear fantastic
fruit. It is a strange and often magic potion he brews from them; dark
and fiery liquids that he pours into curiously designed cups. Sometimes
he gets drunk with his own distillation, and reels between preciosity
and incoherence. Sometimes the mixture is so strong that even his
metaphors, crowding about each other, become inextricably mixed. But as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span>a rule, Bodenheim is as clear-headed as he is colorful. Among the
younger men he has no superior in his use of the verbal <i>nuance</i>.</p>

<p>But it is not merely as word-juggler that Bodenheim shines. He has an
imagination that he uses both as a tool and as a toy. Personally, I care
more for Bodenheim when he plays with his images (as in “Poet to His
Love,” “Hill Side Tree” and certain of the poems to “Minna”), than when
his figures attempt to build or destroy something (as in “To An Enemy,”
“The Interne,” “Soldiers”). It is as a decorator that his gifts serve
him best. Even such an intimate picture as “Factory Girl” is saved from
mawkishness by his delicate sense of design. The composition in which
Death is seen as</p>

<span class="i0">“...a black slave with little silver birds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perched in a sleeping wreath upon his head”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">has a quality that suggests the Beardsley of “Under the Hill.” In the
realm of the whimsical-grotesque, Bodenheim walks with a light but sure
footstep.</p>

<p>There are doubtless other things&mdash;sharper and more important&mdash;in the
following poems that will attract many. But the ones that I have found
seem to have a quiet, unofficial, dignity of their own. Others may ask
for more. For me, they are sufficient.</p>

<p><i>The Poisoner’s living-room. Purple velvet draperies embroidered with
huge lavendar and orange lilies hang over the rear wall, completely
covering it. One great scarlet cushion, four feet high and five feet
wide, stands at the center of the wall against the draperies. The right
and left walls have two small, narrow windows near the top, through
which a dimly glowing light pours, forming a triangle as it strikes the
floor. A narrow tall entrance blocked by orange-colored portieres stands
in the center of the right and left walls. The floor is black and
uncovered. A huge black candle three inches wide and five feet high
emerges from a black urn in the center of the floor, bisecting the
triangle formed by the two streams of pale light. White and scarlet
cushions are scattered about the floor. On two of these cushions sit
Sobe, the Poisoner, and Maldor, his Assistant. They sit to the left and
right of the candle, eyeing each other with a softly-smiling melancholy.
Sobe is tall, black-bearded, condor-faced, and clad in an orange robe,
and black sandals. Maldor is short and smooth-shaven, with the face of a
sleepy girl. He wears a white robe and sandals.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span></p>

<p>Maldor (<i>puzzled and wistful, speaks softly to the Poisoner</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A secretion from the intestines of the cane-rat found in the
Hwang-Ho river, sprinkled with the pollen of jasmine-flowers,
produces a most wonderful poison, O Master. When dropped into the
eyes of a virgin, this poison will cause her face to contract in a
twitching crescendo.</p></div>

<p>Sobe (<i>speaks listlessly</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The eyes of a virgin are too blank for a poisoner’s relish.</p></div>

<p>Maldor (<i>speaks with eager, hopeful emphasis</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The virgin, O Master, provides only the unimportant tinge to the
process. The relish lies in the pompous complexity of the poison.</p></div>

<p>Sobe</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Complexity is but a shattered mirror.</p></div>

<p>Maldor (<i>still hopefully</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>From the irridescent dimples of the Medusae fish I have extracted a
saffron liquid, O master, which mixed with the larvae of
dragon-flies, completes a most satisfactory poison. Administered in
microscopic doses, it creates ribbons of flame in the blood and its
enchanting victim expires, glowing with strange, phosphorescent
colors.</p></div>

<p>Sobe</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I am sick of suavely terrifying poisons.</p></div>

<p>Maldor (<i>speaks wistfully</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What strange delicacy makes you almost brutal tonight, O Master?</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span></p>

<p>Sobe (<i>speaks as to himself</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Wearisome poisons. A droll flutter ... and then always that dainty
monotony&mdash;death.</p></div>

<p>Maldor (<i>speaks swiftly</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>But surely our work still holds you, O Master. You have not become
reconciled to the empty ferocity of death!</p></div>

<p>Sobe (<i>speaks gently</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Ah, Maldor, our poisons lend their little flourishes merely to
life. I would like to poison death.</p></div>

<p>Maldor (<i>speaks aggrievedly</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>But master, those cringing writhings, those indelicate squirmings
and jocund acrobatics which our most fastidious poisons
produce&mdash;what more tender satisfaction!</p></div>

<p>Sobe (<i>listlessly</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>They are but interludes leaving me languidly envious of death, my
master.</p></div>

<p>Maldor (<i>speaks with indignation</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You have no master! Your last poison of moth-blood produced an
effect so exquisitely monstrous that even death was appalled. Ah,
the bones of an old woman, dissolving within her, left her body, a
loose grimace.</p></div>

<p>Sobe</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I am sick of all these sterile grimaces.</p></div>

<p>Maldor (<i>speaks slowly</i>)</p>

<p>Sobe (<i>softly</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>There are no poisons remaining. We have signalled death with many
diverting gestures. We have fitted too many clownish shrouds.</p></div>

<p>Maldor</p>

ashen bag.</p></div>

<p>Sobe</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I will tell you, Maldor, what I have done.</p></div>

<p>Maldor</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Surely, you have found no last contortion for life.</p></div>

<p>Sobe</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have found the ultimate contortion.</p></div>

<p>Maldor</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Some nibbling horror....</p></div>

<p>Sobe</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No, Beauty.</p></div>

<p>Maldor (<i>after a pause</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Beware, master, beauty is life’s revenge upon death.</p></div>

<p>Sobe</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You know very little. Beauty is the devourer of death.</p></div>

<p>Maldor (<i>speaks slowly</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What poison is this?</p></div>

<p>Sobe (<i>speaks gently</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A drop taken into the blood, no more. The skin becomes a
milk-tinted pond in which wine-ghosts timidly bathe. The eyes, like
purple breasted birds, beat against the day. The mouth blooms into
splendours. Ah, Maldor, the drop releases beauty from her thousand
prisons. The victim stands washed in a flood of light before which
imagination dies.</p></div>

<p>Maldor (<i>speaks maliciously</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73">{73}</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>What unique philanthropy is this? Has Sobe the Poisoner dreamed of
immortality?</p></div>

<p>Sobe (<i>gently</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sobe the Poisoner has made a drop of poison which will create
beauty and death. In the soul of its victim these two monsters meet
and strive against each other. Immortal beauty and death remain
clutched in a stifling caress. The poison, as it works upon its
victim, renders her more radiant and beautiful each moment, and
each moment it paralyses her heart.</p></div>

<p>Maldor</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And then what happens?</p></div>

<p>Sobe</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bereft of life, but with a beauty which must resist death, the
tortured one remains my own. Thus with my poison I become death’s
master. Thus that which should die, does not die. Thus death
advancing creates a flame which it cannot stifle.</p></div>

<p>Maldor</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Beware.</p></div>

<p>Sobe (<i>speaks with quickened emphasis</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Death is my slave. I summon him. I open a jewelled gate which he
cannot pass.</p></div>

<p>Maldor (<i>speaks softly</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I do not like this poison.</p></div>

<p>Sobe (<i>who smiles</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You are an amateur of death, Maldor.</p></div>

<p>Maldor (<i>softly</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I do not like this poison.</p></div>

<p>Sobe</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I will tell you another virtue of this poison, which perhaps will
entice your fears.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">{74}</a></span></p>

<p>Maldor</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What is this virtue?</p></div>

<p>Sobe</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Other poisons I have made provided us only with that little
frenzied prelude to death. Our victims have amused us somewhat,
with unconscious heavings&mdash;little, docile marionettes in the
torments of poisons. But now, Maldor, our subject, inspired by the
ever-increasing loveliness of her body, by the ever-growing flame
of her beauty, resists in a torment beyond those instinctive spasms
and dimly-felt agonies. Her overwhelming desire to prolong her
beauty makes the struggle against death wondrously hideous.</p></div>

<p>Maldor</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>But since you say she cannot die, where will those struggles lead
her?</p></div>

<p>Sobe</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I do not know. I know only that a woman whose beauty feeds upon the
shadows of death, must amuse us with a miracle.</p></div>

<p>Maldor (<i>softly</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The virtue of this poison does not appeal to me. The miracle you
promise is cluttered with subtle doubts. Death, betrayed, may
blindly wander. Let us rather return to our pathetically certain
poisons and revel in the final froth-sprinkled caperings of life.
Ah, the powdered hair of the white caterpillar, steeped in
moon-light, will cause the eyes to swell out of their sockets, and
the tongue to burst.</p></div>

frenzied struggles. No longer do they intrigue him. He yearns for

within you will sharpen to madness your desire to live, and my

<p><i>A great window of palest purple light. The lower corner of the window
is visible. A dark purple wall frames the window, and narrow rectangles
of the wall, below and to the left of the window-corner, are visible.
Before the window corner is the portion of a pale pink floor. One tall
thin white candle stands against the dark purple rectangle of wall to
the left of the window-corner. It bears a narrow flame which remains
stationary. Soft and clear light pours in from the window-corner and dim
shapes stand behind it. The Mad Shepherd appears from the left. He holds
a reed to his lips, but does not blow into it. A long brown cloak drapes
him: black sandals are on his feet. His black hair caresses his
shoulders; his face is young. He pauses, three-fourths of his body
framed by the palest purple window-corner.</i></p>

<p>The Mad Shepherd (<i>addressing the palest purple window-corner</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I’ve lost a tune. It’s a spirit-rose, and a reed-limbed boy ran
before me and whisked it past my ears before<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">{86}</a></span> I could seize him.
Have you seen him, window clearer than the clashing light-bubbles
in a woman’s eyes? (<i>A pause.</i>) I sat on a rock in the midst of my
sheep and smiled at the piping of my young soul, as it climbed a
spirit-tree. Soon it would whirl joyously on the tip of the tree,
and my heart would turn with it. Then the song brushed past me and
made my head a burning feather dropping down. I stumbled after it,
over the sun-dazed hills, and the reed-limbed boy would often stop,
touch both of my eyes with the song-flower, and spring away. I saw
him dance into this black palace. I followed, through high
corridors, to you, palest purple window, towering over me like a
silent mass of breath-clear souls. He has gone. Palest purple
window, tell me where he is?</p></div>

<p class="fann">(<i>There is a short silence. The Mad Shepherd stands despairingly
fingering his reed. The Narcissus Peddler appears from the right. He is
an old man, a huge basket of cut narcissus strapped to his back. His
body is tall and slender; his face a bit yellow, with a long
silver-brown beard. His head is bare. He wears a black velvet coat, pale
yellow shirt, soft grey, loose trousers, and black sandals. He rests his
basket upon the floor. The Mad Shepherd takes a step toward him,
wearily.</i>)</p>

<p>The Narcissus Peddler</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A Voice walked into me, one day. How he found me, sleeping between
two huge purple hills, I do not know. He said with a laugh that had
ghosts of weeping in it that he knew a garden where narcissus
flowers grew taller than myself. What was there to do?&mdash;my soul and
I, we had to walk with him. He led us to this palace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">{87}</a></span> spinning the
thread of a laugh behind him so that we could follow. But now he
has gone, and there is no garden&mdash;only a palest purple window.</p></div>

<p>The Mad Shepherd</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We can leap through this window, but it may be a trap.</p></div>

<p>The Narcissus Peddler</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Or a dream?</p></div>

<p>The Mad Shepherd</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Perhaps this is a dream that is true&mdash;an endless dream.</p></div>

<p>The Narcissus Peddler</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Can that be death?</p></div>

<p>Mad Shepherd (<i>pointing to the other’s basket</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>With death, you would have left your narcissus behind you, for
fragrance itself.</p></div>

<p>Peddler</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If my life has melted to an endless dream, my chase is over. I
shall sit here and my soul will become an endless thought of
narcissus.</p></div>

<p class="fann">(<i>He seats himself beside his basket; Shepherd stands despairingly; the
Slender Nun appears from the right: She is small and her body like a
thin drooping stem; she wears the black dress of a nun but her child
face is uncovered. Her feet are bare. She stops, standing a step away
from the Peddler.</i>)</p>

<p>The Slender Nun</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I see a candle that is like an arm stiffened in prayer. (<i>She
pauses.</i>) Palest purple window, is my soul standing behind you and
spreading to light that gently thrusts me down? A flamed-loosed
angel lifted it from me. I ran after him. He seemed to touch you,
window, like a vapor kiss dying upon pale purple silk. (<i>A
pause.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span> Must I stand here always waiting for my soul, like a
flower petal pressed deep into the earth by passing feet?</p></div>

<p>The Shepherd</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You have lost a soul and I a tune. Let me make you the tune and you
make me your soul. You could sit with me on my rock in the hills
and make a soul of my reed-rippling, and, piping of you, I might
weave a new tune.</p></div>

<p>The Nun</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Can you give me a soul that will be Christ floating out in clear
music? Only then I would go with you.</p></div>

<p>Shepherd (<i>sadly</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My music is like the wet, quick kiss of rain. It knows nothing of
Christ.</p></div>

<p class="fann">(<i>A short silence.</i>)</p>

<p class="fann">(<i>The Wine-Jar Maiden appears from the right. She is tall and pale
brown; upon her head is a long pale green jar; her hair is black and
spurts down. Her face is wide but delicately twisted. She wears a thin
simple pale green gown, with a black girdle about her waist, one
tasseled end hanging down. She stops a little behind the Slender Nun,
and lowers her wine-jar to the floor. The Nun turns and partly faces
her. The Narcissus Peddler looks up from where he has sat, in a reverie,
beside his basket.</i>)</p>

<p>The Wine-Jar Maiden</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My heart was a wine jar stained with the roses of frail dreams and
filled with wine that had turned to shaking, purple mist. One day I
felt it wrenched from me, and mist-drops that flew from it, as it
left, sank into my breast and made me shrink. I could not see the
thief, but I followed the scent of my heart trailing behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">{89}</a></span> him.
It brought me here; but at this palest purple window it died. Scent
of my heart, have you spread over this huge window, and must I
stand forever looking upon you?</p></div>

<p class="fann">(<i>The Narcissus Peddler slowly rises and takes a stride toward the
palest purple window.</i>)</p>

<p>The Narcissus Peddler</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>That dim shape behind the window&mdash;I believe it is a huge narcissus.
I am a rainbow-smeared knave to stand here juggling little golden
balls of dreams. I shall spring through the window.</p></div>

<p>The Slender Nun</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Take my hand when you spring. Perhaps this is God’s forehead, and
we shall melt into it, like billows of rain washing into a cliff.</p></div>

<p>The Wine-Jar Maiden</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If I leap through this window, a cloak of my heart-scent may hang
to me. I shall touch the cloak, now and then, and that shall be my
life.</p></div>

<p>The Mad Shepherd</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I must sit here, and whirl with my young spirit. If I cannot knit
together strands of music better than the tune I ran after, then I
should not have chased it.</p></div>

<p class="fann">(<i>After a short silence the Narcissus Peddler and the Slender Nun, hand
in hand, leap through the window-corner and vanish. The Wine Jar Maiden
leaps after them, a moment later, and also disappears. The Mad Shepherd
sits down and blows little fragments of piping into his reed, long
pauses separating them. As he does this, he looks up at the window, his
head motionless. The Narcissus Peddler, the Slender Nun and the Wine
Jar</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span> <i>Maiden appear from the left walking slowly, in single file, as
though in a trance. The Narcissus Peddler stands beside his basket,
which he left behind him; the Wine Jar Maiden beside her jar, and the
Slender Nun between them.</i>)</p>

<p>The Mad Shepherd (<i>looking up, astonished</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You return, like sleep-drooping poplar trees that have been given
wings, and after long journeyings, fly back to their little
blue-green hills.</p></div>

<p>The Narcissus Peddler</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>After we sprang we found ourselves in a high corridor, whose air
was like the breath of a dying maiden&mdash;the corridor we first walked
down, before we came to this palest purple window.</p></div>

<p>The Mad Shepherd (<i>wonderingly</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A dream with a strange, buried, quivering palace whose doors are
closed....</p></div>

<p class="fann">(<i>The poet quietly appears from the right. He is dressed in a deep
crimson robe, pale brown turban and black sandals; his head is bare. He
surveys the others a moment, then touches the shoulder of the Wine Jar

<div class="blockquot"><p>You are all in my heart&mdash;a wide space with many buried, black
palaces, huge pale-purple windows, hills with rocks for mad
shepherds, strolling flower-venders, wine-jar maidens dancing in
high courtyards hushed with quilted star-light, and sometimes a
slender nun walking alone through the aisles of old reveries. I
have woven you into a poem, and you were drawn on by me. But when
my poems are made I take my people to a far-off garden in my heart.
There we sit beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span> one of the shining trees and talk. There I
shall give you your soul, your heart, your song&mdash;and your huge
narcissus flower. And out of them make other poems, perhaps? Who
knows? Come.</p></div>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
